Milestone 2: Implement Functionality (In Progress)

Core Functionality:
The team has implemented core functionality, excluding data access. Placeholder functions are used to simulate data retrieval for testing purposes.

Testing for Input Violations:
The app has been rigorously tested for input violations. User input during registration and login is thoroughly validated to handle potential errors.

Milestone 3: Data Persistence (Planned)
Data Persistence Description:
The team is in the planning phase for data persistence strategies, which may include the design of a local database schema and defining API endpoints for remote data access. A document will be provided to comprehensively describe these strategies.
Future Considerations:
•	The team is open to future enhancements and is considering the implementation of tabbed navigation. This will be discussed further with the instructor or TA.
•	Version Control and Contributions:
•	The project repository is hosted on GitHub.
•	Each contributor commits using their unique identifier, ensuring that contributions are easily identified.
Next Steps:
•	Continue to work on implementing data access functions.
•	Finalize testing for input violations.
•	Prepare the Data Persistence Description document for Milestone 3.
•	This project documentation adheres to ethical and academic standards and demonstrates transparency in development, clear version control, and organized contributions from all team members. The Language Learning Pro project is on course to successfully accomplish its objectives.
